Deep learning requires vast amounts of high quality data. However, obtaining annotations for real data has a high cost, and presents issues with data diversity and licensing. Synthetic data generation avoids some of these limitations, but data diversity remains lacking as long as static 3D models and assets are used. To address this problem, we introduce The Procedural Outdoors Scene Generator, a Python framework that combines data from various Geographic Information Systems with procedural modeling techniques, to generate realistic scenes with high data variance and diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the system by generating datasets to be used for training a machine learning model that detects railroad tracks.
